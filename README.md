# Tweets-analysis-project
This repo provides an analysis and evaluation of the current situation of COVID-19, which people stayed home, and the government implemented self-isolation to avoid the risk of virus spreading.

This project aims to develop software to collect the tweets from Twitter and also analyse the data to make them virtual on the map.
